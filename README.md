<h1> Single Page Application using React to create a personal portfolio website to showcase what I have been up to </h1>
</br>
Goals

Build a single page application (SPA) using the React and p5js libraries. A poetic approach to web-design by visualizing data in a creative coding enviroment using p5 library. As well to combine the React declarative programming approach and imperative one for direct DOM manipulation. Avoid any collisions, performance issues, and memory leaks. Use the best of the both approaches.
